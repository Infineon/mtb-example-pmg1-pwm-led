## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[PWM LED](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-pwm-led)" application with the desired name "MyPwmLed" configured for the *PMG1-CY7110* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id PMG1-CY7110 --app-id mtb-example-pmg1-pwm-led --user-app-name MyPwmLed --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

## Operation

1. Ensure the steps listed in the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section are completed.

2. Ensure the jumper shunt on the power selection jumper (J5) is placed at positions 2-3 to enable programming.

3. Connect the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU prototyping kit to your PC using a USB Type-C cable through the KitProg3 USB Type-C port (J1). This cable is used for programming and debugging the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU device.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=PMG1-CY7110 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

5. After programming the kit, disconnect the USB cable and change the position of the power selection jumper (J5) to 1-2 to power the kit in operational mode. Do not change the position of the jumper (J5) while the cables are connected to the power source.

6. Connect the PMG1 USB PD sink port (J10) to the PC or a power adapter using a USB Type-C cable.

7. The application starts automatically. Confirm that the onboard user LED (LED3) blinks at 1 Hz with the 10% duty cycle (default) as defined in `PWM_DUTY_CYCLE` in the *main.c* file.

8. Vary the duty cycle in percentage of the PWM period by modifying the value of `PWM_DUTY_CYCLE` and observe the difference in LED ON and LED OFF time.

## Debugging


You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**.

Ensure that the board is connected to your PC using the USB cables through the KitProg3 USB Type-C port and the PMG1 USB PD sink port, with the jumper shunt on power selection jumper (J5) placed at position 1-2.

See the "Debug mode" section in the kit user guide for debugging the application on the CY7110 prototyping kit. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


## Design and implementation

TCPWM block runs a 16-bit counter that can be configured as timer, counter, PWM, or quadrature decoder. In this example, the TCPWM block is configured in PWM mode (left-aligned) to generate a PWM signal of the required duty cycle. The TCPWM peripheral is assigned a clock signal of frequency 1 kHz.

To generate a PWM signal with time period as 1 second, the required TCPWM period count value can be calculated as follows:

    TCPWM period count value = PWM time period * TCPWM clock frequency                    
                             = 1 * 1000
                             = 1000 counts 
                         
The TCPWM compare value is used to set the duty cycle of the PWM signal. Whenever the count value reaches the compare value or when the counter overflows, the PWM output signal changes the state resulting in both ON and OFF time based on the compare value chosen. The PWM output is inverted to feed the active low driven user LED (LED3). 

To generate a PWM signal with 10% duty cycle, the required TCPWM compare value can be calculated as follows:

    TCPWM compare count value = TCPWM period count value * duty cycle / 100                   
                              = 1000 * 10 / 100
                              = 100 counts 

**Note:** For more details on the configuration of TCPWM in the PWM mode, see the device specific Architecture Technical Reference Manual (TRM).

This example uses the following configuration for the TCPWM block:

**TCPWM block settings**

    PWM mode           : PWM 
    Clock prescaler    : Divide by 1 
    PWM alignment      : Left aligned
    Run mode           : Continuous 
    Period             : 1000
    Compare            : 100  
    Interrupt source   : None
    Invert PWM output  : Yes 
    Clock frequency    : 1 kHz
