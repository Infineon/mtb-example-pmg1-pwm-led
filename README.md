## Design and implementation

The TCPWM block runs a 16-bit counter that can be configured as timer, counter, PWM, or quadrature decoder. In this example, the TCPWM block is configured in PWM mode (left-aligned) to generate a PWM signal of the required duty cycle. The TCPWM peripheral is assigned a clock signal of frequency 1 kHz.

To generate a PWM signal with time period as 1 second, the required TCPWM period count value can be calculated as follows:

    TCPWM period count value = PWM time period * TCPWM clock frequency                    
                             = 1 * 1000
                             = 1000 counts 
                         
The TCPWM compare value is used to set the duty cycle of the PWM signal. Whenever the count value reaches the compare value or when the counter overflows, the PWM output signal changes the state resulting in both ON and OFF time based on the compare value chosen. The PWM output is inverted to feed the active LOW driven user LED (LED3). 

To generate a PWM signal with 10% duty cycle, the required TCPWM compare value can be calculated as follows:

    TCPWM compare count value = TCPWM period count value * duty cycle / 100                   
                              = 1000 * 10 / 100
                              = 100 counts 

> **Note:** For more details on the configuration of TCPWM in the PWM mode, see the device-specific Architecture Technical Reference Manual (TRM).

This example uses the following configuration for the TCPWM block:

**Table 2. TCPWM block settings**

   PWM mode           | PWM 
   :------------------ | :------------------------------------
   Clock prescaler    | Divide by 1 
   PWM alignment      | Left aligned
   Run mode           | Continuous 
   Period             | 1000
   Compare            | 100  
   Interrupt source   | None
   Invert PWM output  | Yes 
   Clock frequency    | 1 kHz
